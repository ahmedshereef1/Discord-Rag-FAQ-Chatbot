    "\n",
    "Embeddings refer to dense, continuous vectors representing text in a high- dimensional space. These vectors serve as coordinates in a semantic space, capturing the relationships and meanings between words. You can have embeddings by mapping words, phrases, or even entire documents to points in this space.\n",
